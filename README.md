# Tech Looter
A basic fullstack web application to check prices of tech items at top stores using Flask and React.
## Techniques
* __Webscraping:__
Uses the python requests and BeautifulSoup4 library to scrape product information from technology stores in order to display them to the user when searched
* __API Creation:__
Uses the python Flask framework to create a simple API to provide access to the scraped product information
*__Frontend Website Design:__
Uses React to create a dynamic frontend where the user can search different tech products and view them in a list ordered from least to most expensive
## Ways to Improve
* Make the search results more reliable and accurate
* Add more stores and marketplaces to the results
* Add a database to store product information
## Ways to Expand
* Have the website track prices set by a user and send them emails when prices update
* Make a more general Price Looter website that has these types of product aggregation websites for other product categories
